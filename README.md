    GamePlay

    The Ludo game involves 2 to 4 players taking turns to roll two dice (cube shape), each die having a value of 1 - 6 on each side. So in other words, a dice throw results in a minimum value of 1-1, with the maximum being 6-6. It is a dice throw that determines a move. The game pieces that the players move are called tokens, and sometimes seeds. You could think of them as pawns associated with the chess game. One difference though is that no token has any special feature. All move the same way.
